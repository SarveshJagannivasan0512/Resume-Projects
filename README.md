Diabetic Classification: The dataset represents ten years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. Each row concerns hospital records of patients diagnosed with diabetes, who underwent laboratory, medications, and stayed up to 14 days. The goal is to determine the early readmission of the patient within 30 days of discharge. The problem is important for the following reasons. Despite high-quality evidence showing improved clinical outcomes for diabetic patients who receive various preventive and therapeutic interventions, many patients do not receive them. This can be partially attributed to arbitrary diabetes management in hospital environments, which fail to attend to glycemic control. Failure to provide proper diabetes care not only increases the managing costs for the hospitals (as the patients are readmitted) but also impacts the morbidity and mortality of the patients, who may face complications associated with diabetes.

SQL-Driven IPL Bidding and Leaderboard System with Dynamic Scheduling : The objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the IPL auction and match data using advanced SQL queries. This analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of team performance, bidder trends, player roles, and match outcomes based on historical data. By utilizing SQL, the goal is to answer key questions related to bidding statistics, team performance, player analysis, and season-level insights, enabling better strategic decision-making for stakeholders.
The task involves writing complex SQL queries to solve the following requirements:
